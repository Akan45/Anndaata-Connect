## Problem Statement üòñ

Many students miss out on the latest job and internship opportunities due to a lack of awareness about them. Often, they become aware of these opportunities when it's already too late to apply. 
It can be challenging to find verified job and internship opportunities quickly and easily, especially those that are relevant to one's interests and qualifications. 
This can lead to missed opportunities and a delay in career growth.


## Proposed Solution ü§©

 Grabbit, a community-driven platform that provides the latest updates about verified job, internship, and hackathon opportunities. 
 With Grabbit, students can quickly and easily find opportunities that match their skills and interests. 
 Additionally, Grabbit offers a platform for experienced professionals to share their knowledge and insights through podcasts and motivational content, inspiring and guiding students as they pursue their careers.
